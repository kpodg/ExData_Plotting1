Exploratory Data Analysis: Project 1
====================================
## A few things:

1. Each script assumes the dataset is already downloaded and uncompressed on the local computer.
2. Each script file is self-contained, starting with data import and ending with image output.
	* Dataset is selected using a file open dialog box.
	* Only data needed for the project is imported.
	* Script first outputs plot to screen, then to PNG file.
3. By default, NA values do not affect  plots. See [Boston College: Using R Commands and R Commander](https://www2.bc.edu/~stevenw/MB875/Using%20R%20Commands.htm)
